3571216,Archived,Grass (Overgrown),"Commissioner Arreola received the following e-mail from Deb Lancaster on 7/19, 7am:

Good morning.  I called yesterday afternoon and spoke with a customer service rep who advised she would transfer me to your extension.  Instead, I was sent to the voice mailbox of Adrian Santos-Hayes.  I left a message, requesting that he transfer my message to you.  In case that does not occur, I am emailing my request to you.

I reside at 4201 NW 14th PL.  I am a 64 year old widow who somehow manages to keep her yard in decent shape, which activities include mowing.  So, how it is that the City of Gainesville, with its vast resources cannot mow the grass circle on our street?  I have lived there for 41 years and the circle has been mowed regularly (every month or so) each summer.  I'm not normally a complainer, but the height of the grass/weeks is absurd.  I am 5 ft 6 and the weeds come up to my shoulder in some spots.  Of course when I checked that out, I had to wear hard, enclosed shoes, for fear of snakebite. And who knows what other wildlife is lurking amongst the overgrowth? The neighborhood kids, who sometimes use that circle for touch football or other activities, are unable to use it due to the jungle-like conditions.  If the City waits much longer, it's going to need a bush-hog.  By the way, I have observed the mowing many times in the past.  It typically takes no longer than 15-20 minutes to accomplish.  Of course, in its current state, it may now take much longer to mow.

Kindly forward my request to the appropriate department.  FYI, I have made two telephone calls to Public Works in the last few weeks, and have been told ""it's on schedule"" to be mowed.

Thank you for your consideration and assistance.

When I complain, they laugh and say they can't do anything about it. Today, a cleaning crew arrived (10 days after my initial complaint) but to my surprise, they were instructed to only clean the two rooms that currently have no occupants.. Not my or my roomates room, or the apartment in its entireity. The crew themselves commented on the apartment's stench, and upon opening the compartment that shields the AC, they noticed that the AC was covered in black mold, the filter included, and also had substancial corrosion.

Subject: Trash along State Road 24

I would like to bring to the attention of the Gainesville City Commissioners, the trash that often accumulates along the south side of State Road 24 between UF Health Shands and the Malcom Randall VA Hospital.

I gather that this area is sort of a “no-man’s” land with jurisdiction shared (or not shared) between the City, the University of Florida/Shands, and the VA.

I often walk from the parking garage near the corner of Gale Lemerand Dr and State Road 24 to my office in the Shands Facilities Administration Building. I am dismayed at the trash along the walking area—especially the medical related trash such as latex gloves and face masks and sadly copious cigarette butts.

Mostly recently it has been less littered, and I did make mention of the problem to someone at Shands—so perhaps some action was taken.

But what I would hope in the long term is that the entities involved would work together to provide regular clean up this area and a cooperative educational program for visitors, patients, and employees.

Because of the prominence of the UF Health Shands medical facility and the regional status of the VA, we have a lot of people from out of town visiting this area, and I would hope that the city, the hospitals, and the local community would take pride in showing visitors a well-kept public corridor.

Thank you.

1903135,Archived,Grass (Overgrown),"I reported this property 1 1/2 years ago. The owner did mow the lawn and kept it up until he moved. The house was foreclosed on and some repairs were made on it. It now has a sign that a rental agency based in Orlando is posting it for rental. However, I found the agency hard to find on the Internet, but I did finally locate it. Do not know who owns it now, the mortgage company  or an individual. While it was being foreclosed, etc. a team of people came about once a week to mow. Since the agency put the sign up, no mowing has been done since early June. A notice still on a front window has the phone number for the group doing the yard work. A truck is parked in the driveway, but it belongs to a guy across the street who just started parking it there about 2 weeks ago, it may have been vandalized, etc. when parked at the business.  Not sure if this will work, but here is the house on the Internet.

The neighbor to the south has walked into the backyard and he said he saw a hole in the eaves where squirrels are getting into the attic. Birds in my yard chased a 3-foot snake out of my backyard into its overgrown backyard. BTW there is a lot of skunk vine and poison ivy in the backyard, so be careful.

I will be gone a bit of time tomorrow morning, Sept. 10, running errands. Feel free to go into my backyard to look into the yard south of me if you want to avoid poison ivy.

It's 530pm on Tuesday August 21st and I am unable to leave the Hermitage neighborhood. Grays Tree Service has the only street out of the neighborhood blocked with equipment and vehicles. I was told they had 2 trees to remove and they would be there ""a while"". I was told the only way out was to jump the curb and drive through the customers yard.I can't imagine this is safe or legal. What would happen if someone needed  emergency services? Tell a fire truck or ambulance to jump the curb and drive through someones lawn? Thank you.

This is just one of several encounters my dog and I have had with off-leash dogs in the last few weeks alone; rarely have we come across an off-leash dog that did not either aggressively bark at us or come up to my dog with the hope of following her through the park as we went on our way. I am writing to ask if you can have a park ranger visit the park and remind visitors with off-leash dogs of Alachua County Ordinance Section 72.12.

This bus-stop is right at a curve in the road. This could easily have been avoided if there were some bollards on the curb at the bus-stop, so that even if cars lose control on the curve, they wouldn't get on to the sidewalk. Since the bollards are on the curb, it wouldn't affect vehicular movement on the road nor restrict pedestrians on the sidewalk. I've contacted Gainesville Public Works Department (service request # 5836) and said they would approve bollards if it was required. Kindly look into this.

I understand Supervisor, Billy Dampier was supposed to look at the hydrant on June 4, 2018 but it is still leaking. If there's a fire and Gainesville Fire Rescue needs to use it, will the integrity of the fire hydrant caused by this continual leak affect their response?

Two ways, blocking either the architecture or the street behind. Shown is just one example of trying to fill a circle, but (if successful) would block the view to the Cade Museum — not very tourist friendly to do that. Some palms died, but a live oak was added right in the viewline, too. Instead of filling every circle with plant life, which blends in with backgrounds in other locations, please consider architectural shapes like obelisks, arches, columns, lighthouses, sculptures, etc to show drivers they need to slow down. Well lit at night as well. I think filling circles with only trees and bushes blends in with backgrounds sometimes, and new residents or tourists won't slow down in time.

3841784,Archived,Trash/Debris (Private Property),"I wrote on this website a few minutes ago and tried to submit the information. Somehow the description was deleted. I will try again -- hope this is not a duplicate.

During Hurricane Irma three large trees fell from my neighbor's property at 1114 NE 6th Street onto their property and my property. The trees that fell on my property were cleaned-up on September 25th, and the debris was subsequently picked up by the city.

Someone connected with 1114 NE 6th Street eventually hired a tree service to clean up that property. One of the other neighbors told me within the last couple of week that the company cannot complete the job; no one seems to have been working over there for quite a while.

I also have been told that the occupants have moved away from Gainesville; the occupants were not the homeowner. 

I would like to have my fence repaired and my property maintained appropriately; the fence cannot be repaired until the neighbor's property is cleaned up --at least on the south side of their property's back yard. However, separate from the fence repair, I am also concerned about the amount of debris that keeps sitting on the property of an unoccupied and damaged house -- especially when no one around here seems to know who is ""in charge"" of the house and property at this time.

I would like my request to be anonymous. I do not want to risk having uncomfortable situation.

5462416,Archived,Traffic/Pedestrian Signal,The traffic cycle has either recently been adjusted and needs to be re-adjuster for correction or is broken. The traffic at this light in the last month or two is terrible and the wait time to turn left is taking way too long and the flow of traffic is awful.  It's making for more aggressive driving and some folks just running the redlight - if this continue in this school zone someone is going to cause an accident.  Someone of authority needs to visit this area in the work day mornings from 7:00 a.m. to at least 8:00 a.m. to see all the issues occurring.  I spend 10 to 15 minutes in traffic in the a.m. now trying to turn left from 53rd onto 43rd at this traffic light.  Sometimes we do not get a green turn arrow at all - it goes directly to flashing yellow.  Sometimes when the cross walk is enabled when it's done we don't even get a green turn arrow - it goes directly to yellow flashing arrow.  When we do get the green turn arrow it now seems like the green arrow signal is not as long as it use to be - there may be 10 cars that get to turn.  Traffic at this intersection is now more increasingly backed up more than ever.  I have lived in Mile Run for 15 years now and this is the worst intersection for trying to get to work in the a.m.  My commute time in the a.m. is now extending at least 20 minutes due to this intersection and the intersection of 43rd. and 39th trying to get to the interstate.  It's very frustrating with the 'new' traffic cycles and all the long-term road construction that has been going on for months.  We need some relief in this area - traffic and road conditions are horrible - the worst I've seen in the area since I've lived in this area for 15 year plus.,2/28/2019 9:05,2/28/2019 9:49,,,2/28/2019 9:49,,44,0,FALSE,Public Works Department (Primary),CityOfGainesvilleCollaborativeNeighbor,4300-4320 MILLHOPPER RD,29.703258,-82.3888935,POINT (-82.3888935 29.703258000000005),1,2,,2,2,5,5,769,2

2686211,Archived,Other,"I am writing you in behalf of a resident, Ms.  Milligan, staying at Apartment #40 of the Archer Court Apartments located at 3001 SW Archer Rd. Gainesville, FL 32608. Ms. Milligan has been residing at this location for over a year and in the past 2 weeks has reported to Archer Court management a possum problem inside her apartment. 

I witnessed this for myself as a concerned friend when asked to check if the creature was still in the apartment. On Monday, June 27, 2016 at approximately 9:45PM, I entered the apartment of Ms. Milligan along with another friend, at the resident's request. The possum was relatively small and was found scurrying through a hole dug out under the floor board of the occupant's vanity. As we shone a light through the hole, we saw the creature retract further back into the hole. We at once went outside the apartment to see if there was evidence of a hole on the outside of the building where the creature may have entered. At the left side of the building, we found a square opening with a worn grating where a small dog could enter. As we shone our lights through that hole, there was the possum huddled in a corner.

Ms Milligan due to fear of the obvious accessibility of her apartment to the creature and the possibility of it carrying disease found other accommodations that evening. She has since made the issue known to the Archer Court management (Jessica - front desk personnel - 352-260-0843) several times after repeated sightings despite efforts of management to seal the hole in her apartment. 

Since the problem has yet to be resolved, Ms. Milligan is seeking to ascertain what services your offices can provide to assist in remedying the situation. Your help in this matter or pointing Ms. Milligan to the appropriate government agency would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you and we hope you can assist Ms. Milligan in addressing this dilemma.",7/12/2016 16:48,9/26/2018 16:04,,7/13/2016 8:35,7/13/2016 16:42,,1434,1,FALSE,Code Enforcement Department (Primary),Eric Carey,3001 SW ARCHER ROAD GAINESVILLE FLORIDA,29.628325,-82.367092,POINT (-82.367092 29.628325),2,4,,8,4,3,3,767,4

Dear Mayor Poe:

I am writing about the intersection of SW 16th Avenue and SW 16th Street.  

The street light at this intersection was removed many months ago when new stoplights were installed.  The new traffic control lights are now fully operational, but the street light has not been replaced.  

This is a very busy intersection.  It is a block from both Shands and the VA hospitals, and gets a lot of pedestrian traffic before dawn.  

We have e-mailed several other city departments about this in the past month, but no action has been taken.  Let's not have a traffic accident or fatality that could have been prevented by a streetlight.

We trust that you can use your good offices to expedite the replacement of this streetlight.  Thank you very much.

People are tossing them out in the wild, they cannot survive, their DNA is totally different. I am already working with my local officials to stop the sales of rabbits in stores. I am also in contact with local Congressmen and the Governor to put a Bill into place like California has, starting in 2019. The sales of Dogs, Cats and Rabbits will end, only rescue or shelter animals will be sold. This is turning into an environmental hazard, as they spread disease to other domestic animals and humans. I urge your Government to stop the sales of rabbits. The rabbits at this store are ending up in shelters to be destroyed when they get to old and or a rescue will step in and take. The rescues, all over Florida are full with more coming in everyday. Please help us make this happen, sooner then later. I live in St. Lucie County and Port St Lucie, my Mayor is already putting it into place. We also had the law changed, NO sales or giving away of Baby Rabbits under the age of 8 weeks. Please ask any rescue, how you can tell the difference, so your Animal Control and enforce this new law. Gainesville Rabbit Rescue is overwhelmed and trying to save every Rabbit that comes through that store, and its just to much. I work closely with a lot of the rescues and everyone is overwhelmed. Please contact them and ask how this can be stopped.

When the Fletcher Oaks development was being put in, the developer dug up the grassy strip on the north side of NW 31st Avenue between the road and the sidewalk to put in a drainage pipe between NW 26th and NW 27th Streets that met up with the sewer at the corner of NW 31st Avenue and NW 27th Street. During that work the developer removed many trees that the City of Gainesville and neighbors had planted in that strip. The five photos below demonstrate that fact. Requested is for similar-sized trees to those removed be planted to maintain the beautiful tree canopy of this scenic road and sidewalk.

The five photos are as follow:
Photo 1: Name of newly developed neighborhood for which the developer removed the trees (Fletcher Oaks)
Photo 2: Street sign at the entrance of the new development
Photo 3: View looking east from the above-noted corner showing the older existing trees, as well as the trees the City planted within the last 10 years in the distance 
Photo 4: Closer view of the remaining trees the City planted along NW 31st Avenue east of NW 26th Street to maintain the tree canopy
Photo 5: View west from the corner of NW 31st Avenue and NW 26th Street showing the strip of land from which trees were removed by the developer and not replanted.

Your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated. If I can provide any additional information let me know.

Us local residents aren't sure if we can report the people loitering around the building. They appear to sleep in front, to the side, and probably behind the building. It's a daily thing with them sometimes heading out and leaving it before returning in the afternoons.

Please let me know if I should be reporting this regularly (in which case I can text an officer if that's easier or open repeated cases here), or if there is no point in reporting this issue at all (meaning they have the right to live around this abandoned building).

Some (not all) of the vehicles that are currently parked on the side of the road are inoperable (mechanic work being performed IN the street).

This creates a dangerous situation when vehicles turn onto NW 36th Avenue from NW 6th Street and other vehicles traveling at the same time heading West on NW 36th Avenue meet at that intersection with only enough room for one vehicle to get by. When this happens one car must pull into a residential driveway or drive their vehicle in reverse just so one car can pass. If a driver stops short when turning onto NW 36th Avenue from NW 6th Street (because they see a road block/traffic jam ahead) this could cause an accident on NW 6th where other unaware drivers going 40+ mph are not expecting to come to a complete stop to wait for the traffic to clear on NW 36th Avenue.

7184666,Archived,General Code Issue,"The house at 2138 NW 29th Place has an unsecured swimming pool.  I live nearby.  I have small children, and they sometimes try to get in the pool.  They can't swim.  2138 is a whole house vacation rental posted to AirBnB, VRBO, and HomeAway, which is intermittently vacant and intermittently occupied by people who have rented the house like a hotel and are there only briefly. The owner lives in California and does not respond to text messages.  The property manager for the vacation rental, Tammy Broxson, has stated that my 4 year old son is trespassing when he's run into the yard and through the gate to the edge of the swimming pool to try and get in the pool, that she is not required to secure the pool, and that she will not secure the pool.
=================
I reported the unsecured pool to code enforcement in December 2019.  At that time, the gates were hanging open.  Code Enforcement left a note on the door.  Now the gates are closed, and there is a lock on each gate.  For the gate on the west side of the house, the gate and fence post are so far apart that I can walk up and pull lightly on the gate and it opens.  So, even though the gate is closed, it's very easy to open it by pushing or pulling and someone doesn't even have to lift the latch to get in.
=================
I, or a child, or anyone else can see the swimming pool from the street, walk up to the gate on the west side of the house, pull it open, and walk up to the edge of the pool.
=================
The swimming pool is a life threatening hazard, because it's deep water that someone can drown in.  The swimming pool needs to be secured.
=================
I attached a photo showing that the gate easily swings open and closed even with a padlock on the fork latch.
=================
Florida Statutes section 515.29 requires pools to be fenced and have a latch or lock on any gates which can't be operated from outside the gate by children. That law is here http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm? App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=05000599/0515/0515.html . Florida Statutes, section 515.29(3) states, ""Gates that provide access to swimming pools must open outward away from the pool and be selfclosing and equipped with a self-latching locking device, the release mechanism of which must be located on the pool side of the gate and so placed that it cannot be reached by a young child over the top or through any opening or gap.""
=================
Florida Building Code section 424.2.17.1.2 describes requirements for residential swimming pool fencing: ""The barrier may not have any gaps, open-ings,  indentations,  protrusions,  or  structural  compo-nents that could allow a young child to crawl under,squeeze through, or climb over the barrier as hereindescribed below. One end of a removable child barriershall not be removable without the aid of tools. Open-ings in any barrier shall not allow passage of a 4-inchdiameter (102 mm) sphere.""
=================
Code enforcement can enforce this Florida law requiring a pool to be fenced and the gate to have a lock or latch that cannot be opened from the outside by children. The state law is referenced in Gainesville city code Sec. 13191, ""In addition to pool safety standards stated in law and rule, the following shall apply: (1) It shall be unlawful for an owner or occupant to create, maintain, keep or allow the existence of any hazardous condition, equipment, facility or fixture associated with a swimming pool, wading pool or hot tub. Failure to comply with this section shall be a major violation.""
=================
Code Enforcement declared this compliant with code in CE-18-00468 and CE-19-03359.  That's not true. It's not compliant to have a situation where someone can easily walk from the street into a swimming pool and drown.
=================
A swimming pool gate which can be pushed or pulled open with light pressure is not compliant because it can be opened from the outside by a small child.  That's not safe.",1/7/2020 20:33,1/10/2020 12:38,,,1/8/2020 8:12,,698,0,FALSE,Code Enforcement Department (Primary),Wilhelmina Randtke,2138 NW 29TH PL,29.679939,-82.3527945,POINT (-82.3527945 29.679938999999997),1,2,,3,2,4,4,770,2

It seems that the amount of beeping noises increases every day. These are subtle beeping sounds that sometimes start as early as 2 AM in the morning and do not stop. It has gotten to a point where I am wearing construction earphones with earplugs when I go to sleep and I can still hear these sounds. If this continues, I will be moving to the country when my lease expires next year... I ask that you please look into this, especially when construction workers/trucks are starting their shifts at 2 AM. I can understand going from 8AM to 6 PM (working hours), but this is during sleep hours...

6156370,Archived,Trash/Debris (Private Property),"Currently NW 55th Blvd is clean due to private citizens doing a clean-up. But it is a pervasive problem that the property owners should take care of.  The next road on NW 55th Ave. is currently terribly littered.

""I live in an apartment complex on NW 55th Blvd and the amount of litter people toss out of their cars daily is astounding. It is a curvy road with no sidewalks, in a wooded area, with two gas stations nearby. It is my understanding that this street is not managed by the City of Gainesville and it is not managed by Alachua County (although the EPA does drive by to check Hogtown Creek). Public Works does not mow or remove the litter. I’m told the street is privately owned, but only Creekwood Apts (where I live) picks up litter in front of their property. So, is there a way to contact the street owner? Particularly Palmetto Crerk and Palmetto Walk, which both have copious Litter along their entrances, in the woods. Is this a code violation? I’d like to discuss whether I am allowed to put up signage to encourage folks to keep NW 55th Blvd street clean. See my Instagram account #LitterFreeGNV to view some of the litter I’ve picked up there in only a few months. I find diapers, syringes, and drug baggies regularly, and we live near the creek! . It is relentless. People dump tires and all kinds of other stuff in the forest and on roadsides, as well. We need a litter education campaign in Gville that goes beyond the annual Great American Clean-up. That event is great, but it’s not enough... I see litter all over Gville and it saddens me. I’m sure the plastic bag and styrofoam ban will help; but a bottle deposit would also help; I find tons of recyclables, too. I’d like to discuss how you can help me help my neighborhood.""",7/8/2019 10:28,12/21/2019 10:22,7/25/2019 10:27,,7/25/2019 10:31,24479,24483,17,FALSE,Public Works Department (Primary),An anonymous SeeClickFix user,NW 55TH AVE,29.70476441,-82.34990993,POINT (-82.34990993 29.70476441),1,2,,1,2,7,7,1079,2

Good Afternoon Mayor Poe and Commissioners,
I wrote in approximately 2 weeks ago about this same issue.  
In taking a bike ride through downtown today, toward Depot Park, I encountered the same trash accumulation I reported on 2 weeks ago outside the now closed Sweet Mel’s Restaurant. The issue has clearly not been addressed and now there is additional trash present and the wooden fence door now stands open exposing the debris to an even greater degree.  This is a main thoroughfare to our downtown area.  There are frequent articles and statements by Mayor Poe and the Commissioners stating they would like to improve the Downtown/East side of Gainesville yet this particular issue goes seemingly unchecked. The owner of the property, per public record is a local urologist.  It is unfortunate that there are people in this town who choose to litter and not take pride in themselves and or their town.  It is however, the owners responsibility to ensure their property is managed properly and kept clean.  If this issue occurred in one night, I could understand there may be a delay in the owner’s responsiveness to tend to the debris.  This is not the case in this instance.  If this were public property, certainly the City would put our taxpayer dollars to work to clean the area.  The fact that it is privately owned posses a different issue.  Please, take action.  Please take a walk, make a call…

Is this what we want for Gainesville?  Is this the picture we want for our ""New American City"" ad??

Message:
Hello, On April 10 <(>&<)> 11, 2019, GRU did an emergency replacement of
my water feed line and this problem was caused by the SE 4th street
construction project. The line replacement caused the ""rainwater
management curb"" in front of my house to be damaged. The rainwater curb
keeps my house from flooding and the road run-off from going down the
hill to Sweetwater Creek. Please consider re-evaluating the storm water
management on SE 14th Place as a lot of rainwater runs from the crest of
14th Place (which is most of the road) towards my house. Thank you,

This causes a large accumulation of standing water that I am concerned to be a health hazard as the water backs up and inundates the play area and parking lot making it difficult for parent pick up and drop off.  As well, the standing water is likely to be a risk as a breeding ground for mosquitoes and bacteria where there are obviously children present. I understand that this is private property, but if the drainage system was damaged from a tree on city property, and in the interest of the children who attend this facility, I'd like to encourage GRU or City of Gainesville to take another look at this problem before it becomes a serious health risk. The water stands for days on end after heavy rains.

The reason I thought I should say something is that I noticed that drivers are beginning to drive in the bicycle lanes (to avoid the ""bumpy manholes""). So, this could create a problem for bicyclists. Sometimes the visibility isn't too great at nighttime. So, drivers may find it difficult to see bicyclists riding in those bicycle lanes.

Legal, safe parking is available on the rights of way half a block north. I never received a reply and the problem continues unabated. The attached photo is from Wed. Can you tell us what's being done to alleviate this safety hazard? Thanks.

""Years ago the city posted ""No Parking - Tow Away Zone"" signs on both sides of NE 10th St. between University Ave. and 1st Ave. Trucks and buses were parking there to eat at the McDonad's on the corner, creating a serious safety hazard. Cars turning north onto 10th from University or the McDonald's exit would find (1) a vehicle illegally parked in the northbound lane, forcing them into the southbound one where they often found an oncoming vehicle, or (2) a southbound vehicle forced into  their lane because a vehicle was illegally parked in the southbound one. With the fencing off of the large vacant lot across University for construction, illegal parking of trucks and buses has become more frequent. Like noise it's a low priority, and each vehicle isn't there for long. Would it be possible to get increased parking enforcement patrols there during breakfast and lunch for a little while to at least warn the repeat offenders and help alleviate the problem?

Hello Mr Mayor

            I live in downtown Gainesville and I have noticed a disturbing practice in regards to the trash receptacles. In particular the trash can on the north east corner of the Hippodrome, one farther east next to the sun center by the road and another across from the Union Street Station next to the empty lot. 
          There are never bags in these and they are filthy. Sometimes they are overflowing onto the street. I believe bags would contain the juices and filth from seeping around these foul containers. It’s just nasty and probably not sanitary. It looks bad. I believe better maintenance of these receptacles would greatly improve the esthetics of the downtown. They could use a good pressure washing too. Maybe it is all of the trash bins downtown that are being neglected but these I walk by most days. 
           Also I have conjured ideas to improve the cleanliness of the terrible dumpster fiasco south of the downtown library. Many times the unsightly privacy fence is open exposing filthy dumpsters. There is frequently loose trash on the ground in the parking lot that this dumpster pit resides. It smells horrid and pungent. I believe a better less prominent location could be found for what I believe is mostly food waste from restaurants. I live next to the Sun Center and the dumpster in their parking lot constantly has trash and broken glass in front of it and smells like wet, pungent neglect. If you look at the back of the dumpsters you will see the dumpsters fluid spill way that drains into the road onto what I believe is 4th ave, the road that goes by GRU. 
            Thank you so much for considering remedies to these issues, I feel it will greatly improve the feel of our beautiful downtown. 

Brendan

As this home business appears to be unregistered, it may not be collecting required bed taxes or reporting income or meeting safety and sanitation requirements.

The website (see below) advertising her property says she is renting out two of her three bedrooms as well as a couch elsewhere in the home for nightly or longer stays (some as long as 40 days according to reviews). She does not let her guests park in her driveway and as a result there are often three or more vehicles parked on the street in front of hers and her neighbors’ homes. This is a hindrance to emergency and other vehicles on the narrow street as well as an inconvenience to neighbors parking and coming or leaving their properties.

While there are access points from the Porters neighborhood to the bike trail, there are no pass through access to the sidewalk on the east side of SW6th Avenue from Depot down to about 5th Ave due to a black metal fence.  I am not sure what purpose this fence serves, other than to prevent people from Porters from accessing the sidewalk.  Other areas with high density student housing like Jefferson Place that are just down the street do not have a metal fence blocking their access to the sidewalk, so why does the Porters Neighborhood need to be blocked from the sidewalk on 6th?  Maybe after all the construction is done on SW 6th the city can consider leaving the fence down and allowing the people of Porters easy access to the sidewalk.

2578016,Archived,Traffic/Pedestrian Signal,"I am not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but traffic going north on 34th street gets really backed up from 4-6PM before the intersection with W University Avenue.  Sometimes it backs up all the way up the hill by the wall with the graffiti and goes down the other side.  Not sure if anyone else has witnessed this, but I would imagine so since lots of people seem to be caught in the traffic every day.  Perhaps they are distracted by looking at the graffiti and don't really notice.  While I like the 34th street wall a lot, I don't really like being rear-ended by people coming over the hill near the wall and then suddenly finding that the middle lane is completely backed up.  In worrying about being rear-ended, I don't really get a chance to admire the handiwork on the wall unfortunately.  
Luckily for the very few people turning left on University, there are two completely traffic free turn lanes for them to choose from.  They don't have to worry.  The left turn people are the super lucky few.  The right turn people on to W University also get a nice empty lane to themselves as well, and even have the option of turning right on 25A, and so probably don't really even need a whole turn lane to themselves, but lucky them, they got one anyway.  
Meanwhile the one center lane that goes straight just backs up every day, over the hill, past the nice graffiti wall, full of people who work hard all day and just want to get home to their kids.  Those poor people just trying to get home wait for the light at W University Avenue to change 3-4 times between five and six o'clock before they cross. 
It is worth noting that if you are coming south on NW 34th Avenue towards W Univ Ave, there are three lanes to choose from, and only one turn lane.  Somehow, when the redesign of the intersection happened, it was determined that a single lane road coming south should widen to three lanes at University Ave, while the three busy lanes going north should narrow to one lane prior to University Avenue, with two left turn lanes and one right turn lane flanking a crowded center lane.   
Anyway, hope that something can be done, and I encourage everyone stuck in the northbound single lane from 4-6PM to utilize the SeeClickFix app on your phone or call your local government representatives to let them know how you feel about this intersection.  Just don't text and drive!  Well, you will be sitting there for a long while so maybe it is safe to text or call.  Again though, it is probably only me and I am just being crazy and impatient thinking that we could have two lanes going north instead of one.  I should just enjoy the graffiti and relax.  My kids don't need me that badly, they will be just fine.  Maybe I should encourage them to paint the wall at that time, at least that way I would get to see them a little sooner after a long day at work :/",6/9/2016 21:51,12/18/2019 15:55,6/13/2016 8:13,,7/5/2016 11:54,4942,36842,26,FALSE,Public Works Department (Primary),soodohnim,3401 WEST UNIVERSITY AVENUE,29.65202651,-82.37235237,POINT (-82.37235237 29.65202651),1,3,,5,3,6,6,768,3

The vacant lot to the immediate north of our property at 1109 NE 2nd Street now has a squatter living in a tent. Our granddaughter lives next to this lot, and our two dogs and our son’s dog all use our lot freely, which is immediately next to the tent of the squatter.

The police department suggested that I contact you to start a process to get these people moved. The estate of a local family owns the lot, and I don’t know how to contact them. This isn't safe for our family, nor sanitary, nor is it fair to those who have tried to beautify this section of our neighborhood. There are several tents on the block one block closer to 16th Ave., on land owned by the City (adjoining NE Park), and the fact that the City has allowed those squatters to remain for more than a year is probably why this squatter feels no one will remove them. I'm hoping you can help us protect the safety and sanitation of our neighborhood.

Please let me know if I've reached you, and if there is anything we can do from here.

Yours truly,

Thank you.  (phone: 352-318-3354)

3692800,Archived,Road Repair,"Hello,

I'm a life-long Gainesville resident and am on faculty at UF. I'm sorry to bother you, I tried calling earlier today and discovered your office was closed for the storm. I respect you're busy with storm preparations, as am I, and hope all is going well for you & your families.

I'm reaching out to you as I'm very concerned about the construction on NE 6th Avenue between 1st and 5th Streets.
My home is at 305 NE 6th Avenue, I've lived upstairs since 2003 and my father moved in to the downstairs in 2014, he passed away in April from cancer, so I now own both units and am hosting guests evacuating from Miami, in his home, for the storm.

For the past 2-3 months there has been construction on NE 6th Ave between 1st - 5th Streets.
The road was just paved a few days ago and it appears the gutters & curbs are under construction.
I fear that during the storm, in the sections that remain unfinished, the dirt will erode and the entire area will flood.
However, I'm most afraid of the 8 barricades (they look like this: http://www.bobsbarricades.com/bimages/products/barracade1.jpg) currently installed along the north & west sides of NE 6th Ave in the 300 block (immediately in front of my home, built in 1912).

Officials have repeatedly warned that any unsecured objects may become airborne and act as projectiles, shattering windows, etc.
My home is 103 years old and all of the windows are original and impossible to replace (the lovely warped glass). Earlier today I spent two hours moving everything in our yard that's not buried/secured, into the garage-- the porch furniture, potted plants, hoses, our mailbox, trash & recycling bins, etc., as I'm doing the best I can to prevent storm damage.  Can someone please insure me that those barricades will all be removed prior to Sunday?

Ideally, I'd love to hear that the gutters and curbs will also be completed before the rain begins as the lack of concrete in those areas is likely going to cause water to erode the dirt, pool, and flood-- impacting my yard & home and the Thomas Center south-side parking lot.

With much appreciation & respect,
:)",9/9/2017 0:04,12/20/2019 19:02,9/9/2017 0:04,,9/10/2017 13:21,0,2236,2,FALSE,Public Works Department (Primary),An anonymous SeeClickFix user,305 NE 6TH AVENUE,29.6566362,-82.3221833,POINT (-82.3221833 29.6566362),3,4,2,13,4,1,1,772,4

We have been without power since Monday. A large tree fell in our neighbors yard ontop of our power line and knocked out power for my house, our immediate neighbor to the right, and the two house behind us. We have reported this issue to GRU every day, sometimes a couple times a day since our outage occurred. Every other house on our street has power. We are right across from the Law Library on UF's campus. We don't understand why our problem is continually unresolved. I feel as if we may be overlooked because we are the first two houses on the street and all other homes have power so it couple be possible that GRU thought this entire street was fixed when it has not been.

Please help us fix this problem in a timely manner. This is an old home and it's beginning to wreak of mildew from the heat. Also-- school has resumed normal operations and we are still living without power. Help us understand why this problem isn't resolved! Is there something more we should be doing?

The park often has an abundance of people without dogs hanging out within the fenced area during the day. When they leave, they leave the gates open - whether or not there is a dog present, which is extremely dangerous if someone should be there with a dog. It’s difficult to go to the park without being harassed for money or cat-called.

5459233,Archived,Traffic/Pedestrian Signal,"Over the past several weeks, I've noticed a distinct increase in traffic congestion when traveling southbound on 43rd street between North West 51st Place and 39th Avenue in the mornings around 8:00 am. This is almost a 1-mile stretch that is bumper-to-bumper. I timed a green-light cycle at 39th for Southbound traffic that lasted 48 seconds. Meanwhile, the green light lasted about twice as long for those traveling E/W on 39th avenue.  Having never encountered such a congestion issue before on 43rd, I am concerned that the traffic light pattern has changed to prioritize E/W-bound traffic on 39th at the detriment of N/S-bound traffic on 43rd. Meanwhile, the traffic that gets stopped E/W on 39th is only a few cars deep, compared to nearly a mile stretch of congestion on 43rd. The same issue appears to be creating congestion heading North in the afternoons as well, with NB traffic backed up to Thornebrook Plaza on most days around 5:30 pm.

The raised berm in the Clear Lake area has all sorts of roots growing out of the top of the berm that need to be cut back. The dirt washes away from the top of the berm, exposing the roots.  Lots and lots of people walk on the berm every day.  You even have a real nice parking area for people to park at when they want to drive over to the berm and go for a walk on the top of the berm.  
The roots that are on the surface of the berm present a major trip and fall hazard to the people who walk on the berm. These roots used to be covered up with soil that has since washed away. You don’t need to put more dirt on the berm to cover up the roots. You just need to send someone out there to cut and remove the roots that have become exposed over time. They present a trip and fall hazard to the people who walk on the berm for exercise.

Please send someone out to cut the roots that are sticking out along the top of the berm.  I have tripped on them myself.

There is a four-way stop at this very low traffic intersection.  If you are heading south on NW 3rd street from NW 8th Ave, there is also a stop sign at NW 2nd Ave and the stop light at University Avenue.  Essentially, if you are going south, you will stop three time in two blocks.  Given the low traffic at this intersection, it seems unnecessary to have traffic in both directions come to a stop.  This may even be a good place for a roundabout, given the amount of traffic at the intersection.  At least, consideration should be given to only have traffic stop in one direction.

The decision to change the intersection at NW 3rd Street and NW 2nd Avenue from a four-way stop to only stopping in the south direction of NW 3rd Street seems crazy especially given the lack of visibility at this intersection and the designation of NW 2nd Ave as a ""bike corridor"".

This is a public right of way that is being used as a personal driveway by owners of property tax lots # 9025-3 and 9025-2.  There is no concrete apron at the end of this alleyway and traffic is causing weathering and erosion that results in sand and debris being washed south down into NW 17th Street then west down NW 12th Rd and eventually into the creek system.  We have asked that the City place a truck load of crushed aggregate or stone here to fortify the soil so that it does not erode.  The original request was bounced between City and County and EPA with nothing being done.   Residents in this area pay stormwater fees but are the ones that have to go out and clean up the sand and other sediment that washes out from these areas after each storm.  We don't want gutter and storm sewer engineered solutions but the City should be able to come in with low cost, low tech solutions that  fix the problem (like, as we have already suggested before, placing gravel at this location).

I gather that this area is sort of a “no-man’s” land with jurisdiction shared (or not shared) between the City, the University of Florida/Shands, and the VA.

I often walk from the parking garage near the corner of Gale Lemerand Dr and State Road 24 to my office in the Shands Facilities Administration Building. I am dismayed at the trash along the walking area—especially the medical related trash such as latex gloves and face masks and sadly copious cigarette butts.

Mostly recently it has been less littered, and I did make mention of the problem to someone at Shands—so perhaps some action was taken.

But what I would hope in the long term is that the entities involved would work together to provide regular clean up this area and a cooperative educational program for visitors, patients, and employees.

Because of the prominence of the UF Health Shands medical facility and the regional status of the VA, we have a lot of people from out of town visiting this area, and I would hope that the city, the hospitals, and the local community would take pride in showing visitors a well-kept public corridor.",7/6/2017 16:57,9/27/2018 13:23,,,11/13/2017 16:06,,,,FALSE,Public Works Department (Primary),CityOfGainesvilleCollaborativeNeighbor,STATE ROAD 24,29.6519565,-82.3248251,POINT (-82.3248251 29.6519565),4,1,2,15,1,1,1,772,1

I am writing about the intersection of SW 16th Avenue and SW 16th Street.  
 
The street light at this intersection was removed many months ago when new stoplights were installed.  The new traffic control lights are now fully operational, but the street light has not been replaced.  
 
This is a very busy intersection.  It is a block from both Shands and the VA hospitals, and gets a lot of pedestrian traffic before dawn.  
 
We have e-mailed several other city departments about this in the past month, but no action has been taken.  Let's not have a traffic accident or fatality that could have been prevented by a streetlight.
 
We trust that you can use your good offices to expedite the replacement of this streetlight.  Thank you very much.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Helen Warren,  as I send this, there is a crew from DOC cutting weeds out of the drainage ditches on SE 20 St.  This is the first time the weeds have been trimmed in over a year.

As I told you, the 10 houses on this street pay $1080.00 a year for stormwater  maintenance.  The ditches, now clear of weeds are still holding too much water.  I've been here 32 years, and the ditches used to work.  I want the ditches to drain.  They are not meant to be a half-mile retention pond breeding mosquitoes.

I want the culverts ""jetted"", the process using high pressure water to clear the dirt and debris from the culverts.

Subject: Noise Disturbance 

Hello,

There is a noise disturbance coming from 417 SW 40th terrace,Gainesville Fl 32607 in our neighborhood almost every night. This home has a dog that is left outside all night which barks and howls, disturbs peace and interrupts sleep. They leave their dog outside during very cold weather as well so it’s unclear whether the dog is so vocal due to neglect. Nonetheless it is a major disruption to nighttime sleeping hours and I’m requesting further assistance as it has affected any potential for restful sleep in our home. Several routine calls to nonemergency GPD over the years have not remedied the situation.

About six weeks ago, a tree located in the front yard of Alex and Jodi Farmer, my next door neighbors, was removed by the city of Gainesville.  Three weeks later, my neighbors across the street, Jack and Gretchen Grisby, had a tree removed in their front yard, also by the city of Gainesville and at no charge to them.  At some point during this time, my property was marked by GRU without my knowledge or consent.  Had my college-age child not been home, we would not have known how the stakes appeared in our yard.  On October 29, I was notified that I had a certified letter and waited over an hour to pick it up at the downtown Post Office. This letter was from E. Di Muccio and was a Notice of Violation regarding a dead tree in My yard and that, in order to clear the violation, I would have to have it taken down - at my own expense - by November 28. No tree was marked in my yard at the time, so I had to have the city arborist return to my property to mark the offending tree.  On further review, the tree seems to be located along the same public/ private line as my neighbor's tree. The tree that was recently removed at the city expense.
 
I am a divorced single mother, working for a non- profit company and I cannot afford to have this tree taken down, especially during the holiday season.  This situation has caused great hardship for me and for my family. I implore you to take another look at the property line and if there is any way to have the city help me, I would appreciate it.  I can be reached at my workplace at 548-1000 (from 8am - 4pm), or email: snyoung@oakhammock.org, or my cell phone: (352) 317-5319.  Thank you for your consideration on this matter.

The Mayor and the Commissioners of Gainesville,

My neighborhood streets were recently repaired for pot holes and rough spots. The streets were solid, smooth and level. This turned out excellent. 

Then  you ruined the streets with slop put down by ASPHALT PAVING SYSTEMS. Now the streets are worse than they were. Some streets around here got real solid smooth asphalt. We got this.

The way it was done was terrible. A layer of gravel and tar was put down without warning and suddenly we couldn’t leave our house or return to them, and then we had to drive on it. A week later came the top coat. Same thing. I was ready to go to work and suddenly there’s wet tar in front of my house. I COULD NOT GO TO WORK. PEOPLE COULD NOT GO HOME. No warning. The crew said “Oh well.” This is inexcusable.  You should have warned people. Everyone I’ve talked to is livid.

Then there is the quality of the job. My street, 46th Place, is bad. 47th Avenue is even worse. But then they did pave it in the rain. Tar and water don’t mix.

It is rough, uneven, and peeling up. Weeds are growing through it already. It looks bad. Cars and trucks – especially the garbage trucks - tore it up. Cars that rode smooth now buzz with vibration. Everyone is commenting on how bad this is now, how bad it will be in a few months or a few years, what it will do to our property values. I can now see what  other streets were paved with this substance. It did not hold up – now they are ruts of gravel. This is my neighborhood’s future.

It is clear what this ASPHALT PAVING SYSTEMS is a bad product and they don’t care about the people who live here. It should not been used on a public street. This product should not be used again.

Has anyone from Public Works come to check the work? Have you asked the people who live on these streets about it?  Is there any quality control or follow up? I think the answers are “No.” 

If you think any of this is acceptable, think again. If you can’t afford to do it right, do not do it wrong. This was wrong.

Dear Mr. Arreola,

I am writing you today to see if you can help with a problem in our sub-division.  Several months ago there was an auto accident at the entrance to Monterey at NW 34th Place and NW 43rd Street.  A vehicle went off the road and struck and damaged the sign for Monterey.  The driver of the car that damaged the sign was insured with Progressive Select Insurance Company.  One of our neighbors contacted Progressive and met with an adjuster to see about getting the sign repaired.  Progressive has denied the claim on the following basis.

Monterey sub-division does not have an active Home Owners Association that is responsible for the common areas of the development and therefore does not have an insurable interest in the sign.

It is true that we no longer have an HOA for this development.  Back shortly after the sub-division was built the original developer dissolved the HOA and deeded the common areas like the streets and entrance signs to the County.  When the city later annexed this area they became responsible for the common areas.  So at this point I understand the City of Gainesville is the owner of the entrance sign and would have an insurable interest in that property.

I am asking you for so assistance to see what can be done to repair the sign without any cost to the homeowners of Monterey or The City of Gainesville.  Maybe if the City Attorney were to talk to the adjuster from Progressive there could be a solution to this problem.

I know that the State of Florida requires all owners/operators of a motor vehicle to have Property Damage insurance of at least $10,000.  The State also requires the motor vehicle owner to pay for damage done to the property of others due to an automobile accident.  The problem here seems to revolve around just who owns the sign and has the insurable interest.

Please let me know if there is someway the City of Gainesville can help us get the sign repaired.  The homeowners have maintained the entrance planters and kept the sign painted for many years.  All we are asking is that the sign be repaired.  

Adjuster: Janae Liptlippap. Progressive Insurance Company Claim # 171523285 Adjusters Ph# 352-415-4289

Thanks for you time and understanding.

Sincerely

Scott Oldham

2152170,Archived,Traffic/Pedestrian Signal,"There are multiple issues with the intersection. The vehicle trigger on the left hand turn lane onto northbound 98th St. will trigger when no car is there. This causes a turn arrow to appear even though no car is there. I haven't seen this issue in a few days so it may be resolved already.

Second issue is the light will change to green for east/west bound traffic when there is no vehicle there to trigger it. This stops north/south bound traffic, and due to the previously mentioned trigger of a turn signal for no vehicles turning, adds even more time of waiting on nothing.

Third issue is the timing in general for the east/west bound green light is way too long. It will turn green for a few cars in the east/south bound lanes and stay green for a VERY long time even though it isn't needed at all. It should turn green, allow the few cars there to go, then change back to red shortly after since north/south traffic is heavy on that road.

Last, but certainly not least - the left turn lane onto east 23rd Ave doesn't stay green long enough. The green arrow is long enough for 3 cars, if lucky, to get through. This isn't long enough to empty the turn lane itself during busier hours, and causes many drivers to just run the light. Due to all the issues further up, it can be VERY frustrating to be someone in the left hand turn lane, and since north/south bound traffic is so heavy on this road, drivers often get a chance to turn only when given the green arrow.",1/12/2016 15:58,9/26/2018 7:33,,,1/12/2016 16:05,,6,0,FALSE,Public Works Department (Primary),IamMeeks,NW 23RD AVENUE AND NW 98TH ST INTERSECTION,29.67439752,-82.44655929,POINT (-82.44655929 29.67439752),,,,,,10,10,769,

The left turn arrow SHOULD hold green as soon as the Northbound light turns green. Traffic is always backed up there turning left on NW 8 Ave to drop kids off at school. However - it often flashes yellow instead and both North & Southbound traffic ensues. People turning left this morning had to wait about 3 cycles before we got the green arrow. Worse still, someone in the wrong lane stopped and wanted to get in the left turn lane. He stopped Northbound traffic for 1 cycle before we got the green arrow, could move, and someone could let him in.

This is a traffic hazard. The Northbound left turn lane on NW 34 St turning left onto NW 8th Ave should ALWAYs hold a green arrow during school drop off & pickup hours. 

I called Littlewood to complain, but they said they have no influence over traffic patterns, & to take it up with the City.

I have reported multiple code violation in this address several times. At the beginning of this year, I sent a list of code violations and was waiting for the actions. The inspector responded with the visit to this address and a list of at least a dozen of code violations. I was relieved.  After a couple of months, I believe, I wanted to check the case status, but I could not find my report nor the inspector’s report. Instead, I found only one code violation, an overgrown yard, and the voice message of my neighbor stating he had completed mowing the yard. Where was my report? Where was the inspector’s report? 
Today, one more time, with the hurricane Irma approaching, I report multiple code violations in this address. I do not want my house to be damaged. I do not want to be killed because of the negligence.
8223 NW 53 Street, Gainesville, Florida 32653 resident violates the following codes:
•	overgrown front and backyard
•	access to the front door impossible due to overgrowing plantation (he uses back door)
•	deliberately killed lawn on both sides of the sidewalk
•	not watering lawn which is a responsibility of every homeowner in our neighborhood
•	not taking care of the trees planted next to the sidewalk
•	illegal fence/wall built of concrete blocks (block stacked, not sealed) covered with plastic pieces while the residents of our neighborhood can have only one specific type of the fence
•	flower pots on top of the fence
•	rusted metal rods as traps
•	backyard full of loose junk i.e. old grills, containers, lamps, huge flower pots, etc
•	multiple containers and flower pots full of water
•	backyard infested by toads, coming to our yard through our fence
•	weeds coming to our yard through the fence
•	multiple loose shelves and containers on the back porch
•	the resident does not have electricity but lies he does and uses solar lamps inside to pretend he has it
•	the resident takes baths IN the pool in the middle of the night (cannot use the shower because the shower stopper is missing) while he charges batteries using the extension cord coming from his car to the pool restroom

The problem is that the trailer while parked on the street covers half way of the bicycle lane making real dangerous for bicyclist going north on 9th Street. I have experienced this situation many times my self  and see other bikers almost get hit by Cars.  I have seen the owners of the trailer watching the situation and appears to me they don't care. I kindly ask to please do something about this situation that is putting bicyclist life at risk. If you need more info please let me know,
Thank You

This has to be the busiest stop on this route and it's poor design creates traffic/safety issues every time a bus has to stop there. Will it take a fatality to fix this issue or can someone who designed this two lane back-up problem explain why the project went forward without remedying this area of concern in the first place.

Subject: Central Builder Supply move

Commissioners -

I am not a City resident, but a long time resident of the county and owner of a business which performs building services within the city,county, and region. I don't know if you are aware of what I am about to describe, but if so, have you considered the consequences?

It has come to my attention that Central Builders Supply - a business with which I have had an account for almost 40 years - is moving from their present location at the NE corner of NW 23rd Ave and 6th Street. Apparently, actions by codes enforcement would impose costs on them 
which they cannot justify - they rent the property from ABC Liquor/Lounge - and so they will close their doors at the end of October and relocate in a facility much less favorable to them and, one would imagine, to the City. The building they will be leaving had been vacant and derelict for several years before they took it over and their presence has been good for the neighborhood and them - they have a very active walk-in business, something they previously lacked at their old location on SR 121. The odds are good that the space will become derelict again and the move may result in CBS ultimately permanently closing their doors.

CBS is a long time locally family owned business with local employees. The big box building supply stores like Home Depot and Loew's are the tide that CBS and Contractor's Supply on Waldo Road are swimming against. Is it not in the cities interest to provide flexibility in their enforcement rules to help these businesses, help the neighborhood, and help the city? How much in the way of tax breaks would a larger business win if you negotiated with them to locate here. The phone number at CBS is 372-1111. I remember it because I've used it for 40 years. I hope i don't find it disconnected in a month or two.

1940865,Archived,Right-of-Way Maintenance,"Eastbound traffic continuously backs up on NW 8th Avenue because of the insufficient and extremely short lane to turn North on Main.

The reason seems tied to the curious decision to allow for a southern turn lane for westbound traffic onto NW 1st Street, which chomps up all the space that could reasonably be used to extend the northbound turn lane onto Main.  

Given the amount of people driving east on 8th Ave and trying to turn north on Main (TONS) vs. the amount of people driving west that want to go south on NW1st (NONE! Never seen someone turn there ever! Why do they need a designated lane?!), why not eliminate the turn lane onto NW1st street in order to lengthen the Main street North turn lane so it can hold 6-8 cars!?   People travel dangerously up the median during red lights, but that is because there is only room for one or two cars in the designated left turn lane.  So if you want to catch the green arrow light to turn North on Main, you benefit from riding up the median, since at least half the drivers are continuing east on 8th ave...

There is an uncovered storm drain along the curb on the corner of our street (39th Street) and 48th Ave that is fairly large. We have an almost two year old. I am concerned about the safety of this drain as it is amply large enough for a toddler or small child to fit inside/crawl into and suffer injury or drown. Of course, good supervision is the first line of defense for any tragedy like this happening, but this does not eradicate the need to ensure that safety measures are in place. Is there any way that some sort of safety mechanism could be placed on this drain to prevent anyone from entering? I would greatly appreciate any help.

4116886,Archived,Traffic Enforcement,"SW 23rd Terrace is a 3-lane road which contains many bus stops. Around 9am and 5pm, this road gets incredibly backed up with traffic, making it difficult to use. I believe this traffic is due to new signs that say ""no passing"", and an increase in ticketing for passing stopped buses that are loading and unloading on this street. This street is otherwise legal for cars to pass on.

The intent of this ""no passing"" sign was to make this street safer for pedestrians to cross the road (to get to the many bus stops). This traffic makes it even more dangerous to cross this street as a pedestrian, and is frustrating for drivers, so I believe these signs are actually doing the opposite of what they were intended to do. They are also especially confusing for drivers, given that this street seems like it would be legal to pass on, and the signs are only at the start and end of this road, and most drivers use this road for neighborhood access, and thus do not always see the signs. It would be more beneficial to take these signs down, and instead implement cross walks, or a pedestrian bridge.",2/12/2018 14:01,9/27/2018 17:22,,,2/14/2018 8:27,,2546,2,FALSE,Lieutenant Marc Plourde,Nina,2866-2900 SOUTHWEST 23RD TERRACE,29.62615882,-82.35653806,POINT (-82.35653806 29.626158819999997),2,4,,16,4,3,3,767,4

===================================

This request is regarding the streetlight directly across from 1315 NE 7th Terrace. Within the past six month the bulb was replaced and now the light is substantially brighter than all of the other lights on the street and is currently shining brightly in my window every night.

I had contacted the city previously regarding this issue and they indicated the issue was due to a new bulb. However, while I do appreciate the attempt at safety, without a deflector limiting the pole's range to around the street it instead creates a situation where it feels like there is a full moon every night or a flashlight shining directly into my window. Other houses in the immediate vicinity are shielded from the excessively bright light.

Please modify the light so I am able to get quality sleep again.

I am writing today as a member of the Gainesville community. I have noticed on my drive to my residency every morning that there is a significant amount of traffic on Archer road. It has come to my attention that the traffic lights are not synced properly in order to help with the traffic flow during the morning commute and rush hour. I have specifically noticed that the lights on Archer near 23rd Terrace and Archer near 23rd Drive are the main issue. When the light on 23rd Terrace is green, the light near 23rd Drive will be red impeding traffic flow. I believe that if the traffic lights were better synced with traffic flow, then this would help the traffic issue on Archer road; I think that it could at least help reduce the traffic that backs up in the morning and afternoon rush hour. Thank you so much for your time and commitment to this community.

As much as love Coontie, it’s the wrong choice of plant  for the median. There probably should just be ground cover and nothing else. If you drive a sedan, you cannot see over this clump and see oncoming traffic. It’s poor design. You can see the problem here. I was driving very slow to capture the video, but at normal speeds the problem is exacerbated.

Subject: Rat infestation Gainesville apartment complex

Dear Mr. Mayor,

I live near the Village/Forest Green Apartments on N.E. 15th Street. I can tell you from decades of experience that they have a major rat infestation that they refuse to address. At night you can see the rats feasting in and around the dumpsters--both of which are placed near N.E. 15th street. 

These dumpsters are nothing but rat smorgasbords.

With the recent outbreak of rat borne illness killing one and seriously sickening others in New York City I think it is time that the City implement some sort of policy to directly address this before we have such an outbreak here. With the spring approaching my understanding is that the heat  will exacerbate the problem so now is the time to act.

Forest/Village Green Apartments needs to first move the dumpsters away from the highway at the front of the complex and place them instead at the back of the apartment complex adjacent to the forest so that the rats will be better contained on THEIR property and not be spilling over to the surrounding neighborhoods. 

Not only will this help to alleviate the problem to their neighbors, it will also remedy the incredible eyesore that the dumpsters cause when they are filled to overflowing--which is especially evident whenever a tenant moves out and leaves behind such items as soiled mattresses, dilapidated furniture, cast off clothes, etc., which are usually piled up around the dumpster, not in it, thereby allowing the rats easy ingress to the dumpster. 

Also, rats enter the water drain holes in the bottom of the dumpster. Water usually enters the dumpsters when it rains and a tenant leaves the lid open--which the rats also use as a convenient ladder to enter the dumpster, or they climb up the items piled around the dumpster and jump in. It is this easy ingress and egress which needs to stop. 

Once the dumpsters are moved some sort of rodent control needs to be implemented immediately to lessen the population dramatically. 

BTW, visit the dumpster any time around midnight the night before weekly trash pickup and you will witness first hand what I am asserting here. 

This issue needs to be addressed BEFORE there is an outbreak here. 

I hope that this email does not fall on deaf ears.

Thank you for considering my complaint.

With respect,

Steven Kahler

A close family friend resides at 4111 NW 22nd Drive in the Edgewood II Subdivision. She has contacted the City of Gainesville Code
Enforcement Office on numerous occasion concerning the condition of the property next door (subject property), without any change in
the conditions except that more “personal property” has been added.

If you reviewed the attached pictures which were taken October 25, 2016, I think you will agree that there are several code violations
occurring here. There are numerous vehicles, including a trailer, which if I understand the law correctly must be operational, licensed
and insured. I have not verified the validity of the vehicles. I do not believe that placing a storage shed on the front driveway as a permanent
building is not according to code.

Not only is  the property unsightly, it serves to bring down the entire neighborhood. This place is a dangerous fire situation.  In the event
of an emergency at this address there is no way that the fire and rescue personnel could operate properly. The rear yard is also loaded
with “personal property”.  The property condition and being located in a wooded area and with all the accumulated “personal property” not
only poses a fire threat to itself but to the entire Edgewood II neighborhood.

I have been advised, but not substantiated that a minor child resided in this household.

Any assistance in this matter will be greatly appreciated by the entire neighborhood.

Thank you,

RE: Request timeline for action to remedy flooding on 10th Terrace
Flooding Currently  Too High For Normal Automobile Traffic, including, grocery store, medical appointments and prescription med refills.
Flooding has failed to recede after 2 days due to non-functioning City drains at NW 16th Ave and 10th Terrace.
(Speaking on behalf of 10th Terrace neighbors)
Neighbors report their automobiles and transportation by foot are Marooned due to high water.  Only High clearance vehicles can navigate 10th Terrace.
It appears the enormous demand on the City sewer system during IRMA may have caused these drains to reverse flow , accelerating flooding on 10th Terrace beyond that of rainfall from IRMA.
With barely 2 inches of receding waters thus far, these storm drains continue without noticeable flood relief on 10th Terrace with 6-8 inches of standing water in front and back yards as of 10 AM today. 
Wildlife and snakes have been observed by at least 2 neighbors.
Flooding of home interiors and carpeting has been reported, but remediation of mold issues cannot begin until contracted service vehicles can navigate 10th terrace without flooding hazard.
One neighbor was told that 10th Terrace residents are cut off from all services, trash pickup and USPS mail.  They wonder if this includes emergency calls to 911 and EMT response.
Please advise a timeline of relief for 10th terrace  residents.
Thanks, Harold

Mr. Saive:
Unfortunately, due to the extent of the down trees and extensive flooding, our crews have many requests for service holding.  The entire staff has been working almost non-stop since the winds subsided enough to begin response and recovery efforts.
If this request is not already in the system, staff will enter the request in CityWorks and the management team will work to get one of the crews assigned to this task.  We cannot give you an exact timeline as to when this street will be addressed.
Someone from our office will be reaching out to you when they have an idea.
As a suggestion for the future, you can also enter these requests directly into the 311GNV app and they get sent directly to the appropriate Department and staff person to ensure that it gets a response.
Please let us know if you have any additional questions or comments.

2030773,Archived,General Code Issue,"Over the weekend, a city contractor (Asplundh) completed some very major and very poor pruning on city property. These trees are part of the master plan for the Power District. They are nowhere near power lines, and this cannot be justified by ""utility clearance"". The city codes require pruning in accordance with ANSI A300 standards. The standards clearly specify that no more than 25% of a tree's canopy may be removed at one time, and that lion's tailing is unacceptable. More than 40-50% of the tree canopies on this property were removed - well over the allowable amount. Further, all lateral branches were removed from these canopies - this is lion's tailing. Not only is this prohibited by ANSI standards, but it truly makes these trees more likely to fail in heavy winds or flooding. ANSI standards also specify how a cut should be made - outside of the branch bark collar bisecting the angle between the branch bark ridge and a line perpendicular to the branch. There are numerous tears, stub cuts, and flush cuts - all of which may lead to increased susceptibility to disease and pests. Many of the residents of the up and coming Power District are absolutely appalled at what is happening to the trees on this property and other surrounding properties owned by GRU, and we ask that you hold yourselves accountable to the same standards you impose on your residents. Had one of us done this on one of our properties, it would be very reasonable for the city to issue a citation and require inch per inch tree canopy replacement. Things are not looking good for a redevelopment that is supposed to represent ""quality investment"" in a city that is so proud of its excellent urban forestry programs and healthy tree canopy coverage. 
This needs to be addressed, and we sincerely request that any additional planned pruning of this nature be prevented.",11/16/2015 7:57,12/19/2019 22:25,,,11/16/2015 9:10,,72,0,FALSE,Public Works Department (Primary),An anonymous SeeClickFix user,615 SE 4TH AVENUE,29.6482249,-82.3187528,POINT (-82.3187528 29.6482249),4,1,2,17,1,1,1,772,1

3234891,Archived,General Code Issue,"At 215 NE Boulevard Apt. A Gainesville, FL 32601 and at 213 NE Boulevard Gainesville, FL 32601 the residents do not follow the leash laws and allow their dogs to run the neighborhood, as well as allowing their pet dogs to threaten and intimidate their neighbors & their neighbors' cats, and some dogs as well. The cats of the neighborhood are not safe at all because of their leash-less behavior, and their violent and unstable dogs/dog breeds. As both of these pets are aggressive much of the time when they see their owners' neighbors by barking, growling and often charging right at them while doing so. 215 Apt. A owns what appears to be a dachshund while 213 own a schwarzer. There are also leash-less or loose dogs that people let run daily in the larger apartment building next door, those dogs are very, very large and appear to be Rottweiler/pit bull/boxer mixes or very similar breeds or combinations of those breeds and they bark all of the time (I often hear or see the dogs getting into dog fights in their back parking lot, and they often run up on strangers and strange dogs who walk by or even if they hear them nearby) as someone who has a very intense fear of strange dogs, especially very large or very small ones of the unstable breeds that this particular group of dogs do belong to this is an especially nightmarish reality for me (and I don't doubt other residents of the duck pond neighborhood. as well as it is very scary, encountering these dogs, dog fights, possible animal abuse and their invasions of our lives and yards and even in particular I find this terrifying on a daily basis. I tolerate the noise too, or as best I can, even though the tenant who lives in 215 NE Boulevard Apt. A's dog sounds as if it being abused daily because it whines and howls at its highest possible volume for several hours (8-12 hours at LEAST) every single day of every week, both day AND night and sounds like it is in real pain or being hurt daily. And often times the dog cries out in pain when the owner is home, so I worry over what might be being done to the animal. I suppose that it is just being neglected, as I don't want to believe the worst -then again neglect could be the worst I'm not really sure....But since I don't know what is happening up there specifically in that particular apartment then I never knew what to do.....I can't stay silent anymore though as I am terribly worried about the poor animal's Well fare. I hope something here helps, I hope something changes for these pets that seem to either being neglected, mistreated or left to terrorize the neighborhood. They also defecate everywhere in people's yards and the owners don't bother to pick it up, or if they do its not nearly enough. These dogs wander to yards of their owners neighbors and relieve themselves without us knowing it happened into we step in the whole mess, this sadly is a problem throughout the duck pond neighborhood though, where many dog owners refuse to clean up after their dogs while they walk them so the poop goes un-scooped. It's too bad this also happens to pollute the water that we are supposed to be trying to protect around here. The leash law is a very serious one, it especially affects someone like me (and many others I can assure you) who is terribly scared of strange dogs, especially ones that are non constrained in any way, such as on a leash. I don't know what you can do, but enforcing the leash laws - if nothing else would really make me and I am sure other members of our neighborhood and this community live a much happier, less fearful existence.

3564846,Archived,Trash/Debris (Public Property),"A citizen named Loren Cava called with some frustrations. She left some branches and debris from yard work out for collection. The waste truck left half the pile as debris in the road without cleaning it up. She had to clean that up. She also wants to talk to someone about container specifications for yard waste because paper bags get wet with rain and tear, and other containers have to be emptied too often. This should be reconsidered in her opinion due to the volume of rain we get in the summer.

Additional Comments: Ms. Cava has a good idea. The paper bags do get wet and tear. That however, is no excuse for the
 workers to leave a pile of yard waste in the street. We had a neat small pile of branches at the curb for almost a year before they were picked up. Are there supervisors who check occasionally?

Perhaps they should have used higher early-strength concrete or poured that section thicker than 4” since it is a driveway. Parking is an issue on this side of town so keeping me off the driveway for weeks while the concrete cures is unrealistic.

I’ve tried calling Public Works about this a couple of times (which is why you’re only hearing about this in September) but I can’t even get a return call.

Spending over $50,000 in tree removals for a budget that only allotted 17,500 for the 2017 approved budget. then assessing the owners for the ones that came down during the hurricane. one board member even abused her power and had majority of the trees removed from her and another's yard. So the excessive amount of $$ spent and they took $$$ from the landscape line items to fund the trees, no work could be done at the entrance or provide a sound barrier or something for my neighbor and I.

Several days later I was getting prepared to go to work and I went into my guestroom and discovered more mold throughout the entire closet and some of my clothing and shoes was damp.  Also, the ceiling in the guestroom is wet and full of spots of mold.  I notified the landlord immediately upon the new discovery, at this time the landlord informed me that I needed to keep my air conditioner and the humidifier running at all times and that should fix the problem.  I also, mention to her that I think the problem is coming from a leak in the roof.  She stated that there have never been any issues with the roof and she didn’t agree with that being the problem.

Hi Sean, 
Hope you are doing well. I just wanted to pass along something I noticed when we were last at the monitoring site (Friday) behind your house. Just outside your back gate, there is a depression in the riprap that I hadn’t noticed before. There was also a noticeable amount of sand in the pool at the bottom of the side slope. It seems like there might be some wash out occurring there. It is probably something the city should be aware of so they can address. Let me know if you have questions. 
Thanks, 
Eban

3266912,Archived,Traffic/Pedestrian Signal,"There is a designated crosswalk for pedestrians right in front of the Sterling Place neighborhood. It crosses to the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street into Blue's Creek. This is an extremely dangerous crossing for any pedestrians, especially our school aged children. The traffic coming out of Blue's Creek is coming around a sharp almost blind curve and they are always speeding. As an adult I have almost been hit crossing with my children who catch the bus by the Blue's Creek pool on two occasions. It is not much better for traffic coming into the neighborhood either. Although their visibility is not hampered by the curve, they just do not stop for people waiting to cross. I stood there with 5 other middle school aged children the other day while 14 cars zoomed by. The 15th car stopped for us. This is a regular occurrence, we just decided to count the cars. Since the new added construction traffic of dump trucks, large construction equipment, workers trucks parked on the side of the road, etc. the visibility is even worse and it is unsafe to cross. This is always been a concern, but has been made worse with the new phase of town homes being built across from Sterling Place. Also, the pedestrian crossing sign was down several times since they extended the sidewalk, although I saw a city truck out there last week hopefully putting it back up correctly. I would like to see one of 2 things done, both ideally. 1. move the official crossing east so that it is not right at the entrance to Sterling Place where the traffic comes around the curve right into it. It could easily be moved to where there is already a small paved sidewalk that leads from the road to the sidewalk that runs along the Sterling Place wall. That would allow more time for those leaving Blue's Creek to see people in the walk. 2. I would like to see one of those more visible pedestrians crossings with the flashing lights that notify drivers that there is someone in the crossing. I would hate for it to take a serious injury or death before this issue is resolved.",3/14/2017 14:39,9/27/2018 3:13,3/14/2017 14:57,,3/16/2017 14:45,17,2885,2,FALSE,Public Works Department (Primary),April Tisher,7316 NORTHWEST 73RD AVENUE,29.72153046,-82.39512968,POINT (-82.39512968 29.72153046),1,2,,2,2,5,5,1079,2

I would like to also report about fast traffic driving down our road, NW 13th Avenue, going to the 300 Club. I would like an extra speed bump at the top of the hill (on NW 13th Avenue) or on the blind curve! Children and animals are in danger, as well as other cars traveling in the opposite direction around the curve, because the cars traveling to the 300 club are in such a hurry.

People go way to fast on NW 36th Dr! Definitely need larger speed humps and maybe some signs (Children at Play) to discourage speeders.

I'd appreciate a response to my question left on voice mail this morning. My late friend and neighbor Ann Jones planted a row of 5 or 6 crape myrtles in front of her house, on the west side, that shaded it, cut utility bills, and beautified the neighborhood. Last year, the first thing the new owners did was cut those huge crape myrtles down. When they resprouted, they were cut down again each month until they were finally dead. Now there's just a row of stumps in front of the house. This year the new owners cut down the Japanese plum in the side yard and, this week, the sabal palms in front. I'm president of the neighborhood association, and in our survey of residents, trees were the things people loved most about Old Northeast Gainesville. We'd like to know why all of these trees have been removed and what the plans are for replacing them.

3525647,Archived,Street Sign,"The entrance to Northwood Oaks has become very difficult to enter/exit during high traffic hours. A constant problem are cars heading S on 34th Blvd blocking the entrance to the neighborhood while waiting for the traffic light at NW 53rd Ave. Is it possible to have a sign (?) warning not to block the cross-street (NW 54th Ave)? It has really gotten bad with the opening of the new Walmart Supercenter just down the road. To be honest, it has never been great but things have gotten much less civil in the last year or so. 
Many of us living here have given up on the entrance to our neighborhood and just wind our away out the back to exit out near the FHP station.

Is there anything that can be done??

It would seem more logical for those lights to cycle together, so that traffic on 13th can move smoothly northbound once one of the lights turns green.  Gainesville does a great job normally for light timing, so this pattern seems odd.  I definitely I wasted a lot of gas starting and stopping my car three times in 7 blocks.

Re:  4322 NW 20th Terrace, Gainesville, Florida 32605
 
Mr. Look,
Thank you and your officers for helping out on this residence. We have been complaining to Code Enforcement (CE) since 2015 about the residents in this house.  They constantly park commercial vehicles, equipment, trailers in the street and in their yard, and keep commercial machinery stored under a tarp.  CE has come out on our complaints about the resident running a commercial business from this property and the cases are closed because apparently you can have all of the commercial equipment stored on your property or in the street as long as it’s used for “personal reasons” as the resident’s claim.  Therefore after the last go around with CE and the trailers and commercial machinery they claim is for personal use, the name of the resident whose truck was stored at this address without a valid tag (See picture ""Code Enforcement - CE-18-00114) was Googled and through Google, it was found that they do have a business but not registered at this address.  Two business names with the name Shawn M. Ingram came up through Sunbiz.org :  C&S Plumbing, Inc. – which explains the digging equipment and trailers as complained about before; and the second company name of The Traveling Toolbox LLC – which explains the trailers with the tool boxes attached to them that are there every day after 5:30pm.  They are claiming the principal address on both businesses as a residence in Waldo, which is probably not true or a secondary residence as they are constantly having these trailers and equipment parked outside of their residence.  You can look back at all the cases (CE-15-00413, CE-15-02699, CE16-00686, CE-16-00770, CE-17-00196, CE-17-00194, CE-18-00046, CE-18-00114, CE-18-00289) and see the equipment, trailers, materials they use and store at this residence and can make an obvious conclusion that they are running a business out of this house without the proper permits.  I have attached a few of those pictures for you to review.

March 18,2017
Gainesville City Commissioners: Mayor Lauren Poe, Helen Warren, Harvey Budd, Charles Goston, Todd Chase, Craig Carter, Adrian Santos

Greetings,
I want to take this opportunity to address the commission via letter about a few concerns. On March 17, 2017, I attended my grandson’s basketball game at the boy’s club on 2700 N W 51st Street. As I watched the game I was struck by the number of safety hazards and violations our youth were exposed to.
The following violations need immediate attention:
•	Exposed iron beams without protective padding (west center beam) to soften the blow should a child collide upon impact.
•	Much of the concrete interior walls have no protective covering.
•	Poor lighting at the front entrance is acutely inadequate.
•	Vehicles passing in the area are speeding through when children are existing the building and crossing the street.
•	Street lighting in front of the Boys Club poses threats to walking pedestrians.
My request for correction includes the following recommendations:
•	Install paddings for beams and block wall.
•	Increase lighting at front of building and perimeter.
•	Install blinking caution lights approximately 150 yards in front of Club to slow down traffic.
•	Increase street lighting.
I entrust the commission will recognize the urgency of this matter and make the appropriate decisions to correct these flawed conditions. I want to thank you in advance for your indulgence in this matter and I look forward to seeing the changes.
 As you know, our youth are our number one priority. We trust in your leadership to minimize these dangerous conditions at your earliest time frame.

2123247,Archived,Grass (Overgrown),Owners of 1735 NW 7th Place have not kept their front or back yard maintained for years. They claim that the plants that are grown have been there for many years and there has been at least one complaint issued in 2014 that was closed. Neighbors are expected to keep up the adjacent yards but Joe Schmid and Collopy allow their yard and house to be in complete disrepair. In November a neighbors tree split and fell on the garage at 1735. The limb was removed by Schmids and the rest of the tree was cut down at the 1743 residence at the owners expense. The damage to the building was assessed as repairable- however the existing roof extends 8 inches over the 1743 property line. The damaged materials from the roof and overhang is still in the 1743 neighbors yard. 1743 owner requested the debris to be removed several times. Schmids instead asked to store a Pod over the 1743 property because he does not want to clean his own yard enough to place the Pod in his own yard. Because of the foliage and weeds growing In the back yard the 1743 owner can only remove part of the second large tree that the city arborist requested. Schmid has called the 1743 owner twice about being concerned that the limb from the second tree will fall into his yard on the plants. Tree contractor advised that there is not enough access to the largest limb that extends into 1735 yard because of the overgrown state. 1743 owner is constructing a fence beginning today and cannot get clear access to part of the fence line because of the roof overhang and other items that Schmid has not cleaned up.

Interestingly, the reverse is also true at 5pm...the northbound to west left-turn lane goes first when all traffic is headed westbound. Less of an issue than the morning, though. I recommend swapping the order of the turn signals between the am and the pm rush hours. 

The adjacent light at windmeadows and 34th is also frequently red in the morning when the light is green at Archer, compounds the problem.

6599788,Archived,General Code Issue,"This is a residence.  It was R1 and it appears on current maps to have a designation of U4.  However there is not new construction and it is now being used as substandard residential housing for more than 4 people.  And possibly a business.     Regardless, last year it was determined by code enforcement that a maximum of 4  vehicles could be at the property.   I am not sure when zonning occurred or why we are allowing the distruction of neighborhoods within Gainesville.   Last year the property request 16th avenue parking, and it was denied.  It was also not in the parking plan for them to park on the opposite side of the property.       Even if you swindled in a code change allowing unlimited parking  because it is now ""rental property""   That is a major issue that must be taken up by the City Administrator and  resolution to the error in code  taken before the City Commission.      As I look at the Current zoning map the property is being called U4,   a very bad  choice.  If we are looking to put buildings up to the street along 16th avenue, it should be new buildings designed to meet code, not a modification forming a business that destroys property value behind the business zoning.   Having moved a zoning change without proper notice and hearing should mean the zoning is null and void, and the former zoning stands.     If no other action is anticipated to resolve the issues with this property that are degrading the community then look closely at the U4 zoning and it states  under Parking B. Location of parking facilities. 1. Surface parking lots shall be located to the rear or side of buildings, but no more than 50 percent of the total parking area may be located to the side of buildings.    With that simple statement you not have a zoning violation, a new parking plan must be submitted and proper parking established with more that 50% in front of the building  not the 100% of the property on 12th streed the side of the building.   With the zoning change parking needs to be up to code, paved and properly marked.   With this now being a business zoning the ADA  Required handicap parking must be put into place, ; and an ADA  handycap entrance to the property established.     You also need to note the current parking is on the right-away.  So we have several issues that need to be resolved.    Additionally with the parking access on 12th street a business requires a proper width access for two cars or a one way access for the inflow and outflow of the property.   NW 12th street is not wide enough for two way traffic and when you add the 12th st bike route it becomes a major issue for health and safety of bikers.    This intersection must be upgraded for the U4 standards to be reached or the road needs to be closed at the edge of the property that starts the U4 Zoning.    It seems again some people of jumped the gun with new zoning plans for Gainesville without fully understanding the impacts of changes that are not properly researched, studied and understood.       Perhaps a solutions on this property is to remove all access on NW 12 st,  remove the asphalt and parking roadside,  give that the the city for a safe highway access.    Move the  parking to the far side.  Yet as I have expressed,  with our future city development that there should not be additional paved, impermeable parking allowed.   So the foot print of parking  should not be any larger than the current parking. . That adds an additional issue,  parking on limerock is not acceptable in the city for business parking thus would not be acceptable for the U4 property.",9/4/2019 11:28,12/21/2019 13:10,,,9/4/2019 13:41,,132,0,FALSE,Code Enforcement Department (Primary),James W.

7087429,Archived,General Code Issue,"Unsecured swimming pool (no locks nor latches on gates) at 2138 NW 29th Place, Gainesville, FL is dangerous for small children in the neighborhood.
  =================  
This is a 2 story white building with a pool in the backyard.  The pool is surrounded by a chain link fence.  This fence has 2 gates, which are usually left open, and are not capable of being secured.  The gates do not have any lock or latch to prevent them being opened from outside.
  =================  
This is dangerous.  It's a big deep pool of water that someone can drown in.  It's easy to get at since the gates to the pool are left open at all times.
  =================  
I have small children.  The pool is visible through the chain link fence from public areas (visible from near the street).  My kids have tried to get at the pool when I've taken them on walks in the neighborhood.
  =================  
2138 NW 29th Place is posted as an Air BnB rental and on numerous other short term rental sites. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38580304 https://www.vrbo.com/1803500 https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1803500vb https://www.stayz.com.au/holiday-rental/p1803500vb  The owner lives in California.  I have tried contacting the owner by leaving a video voice message on the Ring doorbell, which is an electronic doorbell and security system to where I can knock on the door and the Ring doorbell will record a video and send it to the owner's phone.  I have tried contacting the owner by messaging through the online hotel sites.  I attempted to text the owner, but am not sure whether or not I have his correct phone number.
  =================  
The property is managed by realtor Tammy Broxson.  Tammy Broxson messaged me back through the online hotel rental site Vrbo and stated, ""Please be aware there is no requirement to have a padlock on the gate/fence. It is trespassing to enter the property without permission. Any padlocks installed with be removed and the property authorities. Best, Tammy Broxson""
  =================  
Essentially, the realtor who is managing the rental for the owner has stated that she has no intention of securing the gate with any lock or latch.  In response to a description of my 4 year old trying to get at the pool she stated that that's trespassing.  (A small child can't trespass.)  The property manager won't put a lock or latch on the gate and won't secure the pool.
  =================  
Florida Statutes section 515.29 requires pools to be fenced and have a latch or lock on any gates which can't be operated from outside the gate by children.  That law is here http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0500-0599/0515/0515.html .  Florida Statutes, section 515.29(3) states, ""Gates that provide access to swimming pools must open outward away from the pool and be self-closing and equipped with a self-latching locking device, the release mechanism of which must be located on the pool side of the gate and so placed that it cannot be reached by a young child over the top or through any opening or gap.""
  =================  
Code enforcement can enforce this Florida law requiring a pool to be fenced and the gate to have a lock or latch that cannot be opened from the outside by children.  The state law is referenced in Gainesville city code Sec. 13-191, ""In addition to pool safety standards stated in law and rule, the following shall apply: (1) It shall be unlawful for an owner or occupant to create, maintain, keep or allow the existence of any hazardous condition, equipment, facility or fixture associated with a swimming pool, wading pool or hot tub. Failure to comply with this section shall be a major violation.""
  =================  
I don't care if you post my information online, and I checked the box to post my info.  I'm not a snitch.  I've gone (tried to go) direct to the owner first through several channels.  A combination padlock costs less than 10 dollars.  For less than 20 dollars, they could make this safe.

The three houses on this block lease from Alligator Realty, and we tried bringing this issue up with them directly but with no success. There is a dirt parking lot behind these 3 houses that fits 15 cars, however it's always submerged under inches of water. The parking lot has large craters all over that allow rain water to accumulate and sit for days on end. Our cars are parked in inches of standing water, and we frequently have to take our shoes off just to keep them from getting wet when walking to or from our vehicles. Additionally, these craters are so deep that black cables are exposed and floating when submerged in water. This presents a considerable safety concern for 15 students consistently entering and leaving the parking lot on scooters throughout the day.
We tried talking to our property managers about this issue because we should not have to wade to our front door in water. However, they refused to fix the issue.

Beyond this, the whole stretch of driving south between NW 5th ave and NW 2nd ave on NW 15th is treacherous, due to narrow lanes, and many people turning in and out of side streets.  Today, someone hit me as I was traveling south on NW 15th and they were pulling out of an apartment building. They never even looked left, they were so distracted trying to see around the foliage looking south (to their right), that they just accelerated into the street when they perceived their right of way on the right clear.  Unfortunately, they also failed to look left before accelerating into the street. 

Just a bad street, all around.  Maybe something more can be done than just improving the right of way vision...

David LaVangie, the owner of Northwood was here to do the installation. The air handler motor inside the unit has now died. It is 30 years old. I now do not have any heat or cooling. The motor went out on 01-07-17. It also does not match the manufacturer of the heat pump installed. I learned just the other day from another HVAC repair service that a permit must be pulled to do any major work or replacement of HVAC components, and they must match the same manufacturer. These HVAC components do not match at all. 

Both my landlord, James Hough, and Mr. LaVangie lied to me when I asked them about no permit being pulled. I notified my landlord in mid-December 2016 that the motor was squeaking and the bearings were likely going out. He did nothing on my written complaint to him. I then called David LaVangie the same day in December 2016, and he told me to put some 3-in-1 oil onto the bearing at the end of the motor. That stopped the squeaking. But then the motor died completely as stated above.

My landlord is now claiming that by following the advice of his own repairman that I damaged this 30 year old motor, which is ludicrous and baseless. (I am a union trained & certified commercial carpenter & millwright). 

My landlord Mr. Hough is now refusing to repair the unit.

My name is Elizabeth DiVito and I live with my boyfriend, Scott Miller, at 432 NW 9th Street. We moved in to this house 5 weeks ago on August 7 and this is my fifth year and Scott's fourth year living in Gainesville in various spots around the city. We have always been impressed by the municipal service the city provides, but we are now realizing that the quality of these services may depend on the relative income level of the neighborhood.

Out of the past five weeks, our garbage has been picked up properly just one time. We have called the city's Solid Waste Division each of those Thursday mornings (our pickup day is Wednesday) and it has still not been made clear to us why the truck continues to miss our street. We are starting to feel like the City of Gainesville is not properly providing municipal services to all of its residents equally. Our neighborhood is mainly old, low-income houses and it seems like the maintenance and cleanliness here is less important than in other areas of the city. We, of course, hope this is not true, but we cannot understand why a municipality would leave garbage uncollected around its neighborhoods. 

Please let us know if there is anything we can do to help alleviate this problem. We would simply like to see this neighborhood reflect the same high standards as the rest of the city.

Thank you in advance for your time and we look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best, 
Elizabeth DiVito

2371583,Archived,Other,"I live in the Pine Park neighborhood directly east of the Lux 13 (formerly Hidden Lake) Apartments.  In mid-March I contacted City Planning to report the pedestrian gate required by the Development Order of the first phase (in exchange for a density increase) was locked.  I was told by staff that GPD requested the gate to be locked for 30 days during an investigation.  I think the 30 days will end soon (by next week), yet I am writing during Public Health Week to ensure this matter is resolved with no extensions.  I have neighbors on both sides of this gate who use it for access to transit and for social visits.  The gate affords a more direct path for some trips.  I am concerned about any proposals that limit walking, because according to the US Center for Disease Control, regular physical activity that is performed on most days of the week reduces the risk of developing or dying from some of the leading causes of illness and death in the United States. Regular physical activity improves health in the following ways:
•	Reduces the risk of dying prematurely.
•	Reduces the risk of dying prematurely from heart disease.
•	Reduces the risk of developing diabetes.
•	Reduces the risk of developing high blood pressure.
•	Helps reduce blood pressure in people who already have high blood pressure.
•	Reduces the risk of developing colon cancer.
•	Reduces feelings of depression and anxiety.
•	Helps control weight.
•	Helps build and maintain healthy bones, muscles, and joints.
•	Helps older adults become stronger and better able to move about without falling.
•	Promotes psychological well-being.
While I support all efforts for local law enforcement to ensure public safety, I also think our City must address public health issues.  I assume that closing a street to vehicular traffic requires prior GPD approval, yet GPD should not be allowed to change the requirements of development approval. if a pedestrian gate is a requirement for allowing a developer more density (ie. Economic gain) there must be mechanisms to ensure this pedestrian access is required in perpetuity.

From: Charles Chestnut [mailto:chestnutfuneralh@att.net]

Subject: Speeding vehicles


Mr. Mayor,

A few months ago I called to the City in reference to someone changing the road of 5th Street being closed off when the children mostly live and cross on S.E. 3rd Street in the Porters Community.

I have been in the 400 block of S.E. 3rd Street because of a sick cousin, and the 300 block of 3rd Street because of a sick sister; the times I have been on the street I've witnessed car after car speeding through the neighborhood.  For the life of me I can not figure out why the City would close 5th Street where children are not effected by traffic to 3rd Street? You divert traffic to  an area where the Community Center with Basketball Courts are, and where School Bus stops are, and children cross over daily.  

I am wondering where the true concern is, because it appears it is not with the welfare of our children.  I have complained about the roads being closed, and am not letting you know that people are speeding up and down 3rd Street, and the children will be out of school soon for Spring Break.

Changes need to made, and made soon.

Thank you,
Gladys O. Perkins",3/13/2018 9:35,9/27/2018 19:59,3/13/2018 9:51,,3/28/2018 16:18,16,22003,15,FALSE,Public Works Department (Primary),City Clerk's Office 2,400 SE 3RD STREET,29.6483573,-82.3223461,POINT (-82.3223461 29.648357299999997),4,1,2,15,1,1,1,772,1

2708204,Archived,Other,"As my previous post was archived and cannot be addressed anymore (Issue ID: 2670763), I am creating a new issue.

Thank you Engineer Waite for your comments  and for providing reasoning behind the disparity in access between apartment complexes on the street.  It will probably surprise you that I do not live one of the affected complexes near SW 9th St.  I am a motorist and a bicyclist who frequents the area.  I personally have experienced trouble as people leaving the affected complexes, which house many people, have made U-turns in the median breaks provided for the other less-populated complexes.  Trying to U-turn in the middle of Depot Ave forces some drivers to do a multi-point turn, or infringe on the bike lane.  I don't see how doing U-turns at these breaks is safer given these other problems.
Given the proximity to SW 9th Street, was consideration given to another traffic solution?  Perhaps another traffic circle or ellipsis, that incorportates the intersection as well as the driveways?  This solution seems to work to slow down traffic, increase safety, and allow access in all directions at other points along Depot.  
Again, I  don't live in the affected communities but I do see the problem and have experienced drivers from those communities trying to utilize the limited median breaks to turn.  The improvements to this street are really great, but this is a problem and should be addressed rather than archived.  I hope that Engineer Waite and the other people of Public Works will take another look and find a solution for this remaining problem, just like they did for rest of Depot Ave!",7/19/2016 7:51,9/26/2018 18:14,7/25/2016 9:57,,8/18/2016 9:27,8765,43295,30,FALSE,Public Works Department (Primary),soodohnim,936-1018 SOUTHWEST DEPOT AVENUE GAINESVILLE,29.6810568,-82.34520841,POINT (-82.34520841 29.681056800000004),1,2,,3,2,4,4,770,2

I wrote in approximately 2 weeks ago.  In taking a bike ride through downtown today toward Depot Park for lunch at Pop A Top, I encountered the same trash accumulation I reported on 2 weeks ago. That issue was clearly not addressed and now there is additional trash present.  This is a main thoroughfare to our downtown area.  The City Mayor and Commissioners are stating they would like to improve the Downtown/East side of Gainesville yet this particular issue goes seemingly unchecked. The owner of the property, per public record is a local urologist.  It is unfortunate that there are folks in this town who choose to litter and not take pride in themselves and our town but it is the owners responsibility to ensure their property is managed properly and kept clean.  If this were public property, certainly the City would put our taxpayer dollars to work to clean the area.  The fact that it is privately owned posses a different issue.  Please, take action.

Earlier this week two bicycles were stolen off the screened back porch of a house in the 300 block of NW 2nd Street.  The screen was cut in order to access the bikes.  The bikes were chained together but that did not deter the thief.

Samantha Smith has installed a new fence that extends about 8 feet south from her property line. I inquired about this to the property manager who said I needed to contact the HOA Board of which Smith is a member, serving as both secretary and treasurer. She responded and said she got approval prior to installing the fence from the Board. As a former board member, I know that an owner presented a plan for a screened porch seeking approval by HOA. This was on the HOA agenda at a meeting in which owners wishing to attended. The owners approved this addition and decided it would be the model to be used for future screened porches. 
I initially brought this up to the property manage because I thought I will just extend my fence onto the propery to the south of my end unit as well. However, I decided this is not the right thing to do because it is unfair to those not owning end units and likely illegal to take in property I don't own.

3424273,Archived,Other,"There has been increased traffic on 24th Blvd (which runs between NW 39th Ave and NW 53rd Ave) ever since the new Walmart opened and it only seems to get worse. With the increased traffic has come increased speeding, and although the speed limit is 35 mph, hardly anyone goes that speed. People routinely drive 40 to 50 mph. How do I know that? Because  a speed monitor was place on the street just before Alpine Way for several days and in walking my dogs twice a day I saw drivers get the flashing light warning that they were over the speed limit.
We are still waiting to see what will be done about this and the strips that are routinely put across the road to monitor traffic volume. It has become unsafe to walk the sidewalks here because of speeding and erratic drivers. On five separate occasions I have seen cars passing on the double yellow line on this street between Alpine Way and Birnam Woods Way. One car did so as our daughter and I were walking our dogs and he almost lost control and did run off the road onto the sidewalk before snatching it back on the road. He came within 15 feet of hitting my daughter!
I am NOT exaggerating in saying this, sooner or later, there will be either a horrible wreck and/or a pedestrian death if something isn't done SOON! These sidewalks are heavily used by pedestrians and bicyclists. Some of these pedestrians are school kids walking to school at Norton or to catch a bus. I walk these sidewalks twice daily and I do not feel safe on this street anymore. We've lived in Forest of the Unicorn since 1999, so I am very familiar with this neighborhood. In talking with my neighbors I know my husband and I aren't the only ones with this concern. 
PLEASE do something (speed bumps, a four way stop, lower the speed limit, and/ or more police patrol writing speeding tickets) to help with this serious problem.
Thank you,

While traveling north on NW 6th St I waited for the light at 5th Ave three times before getting through today, and sometimes it is worse.  All three times today NO cars turned left from the southbound lane, and the unnecessary green arrow that was not used by any turning vehicles shortened the time for the green light of the northbound traffic, which was backed up past NW 3rd Avenue.  Perhaps the green light for northbound traffic could be lengthened also rather than getting rid of the green arrow for southbound.  Either way, a little longer reen light time for northbound traffic between 4:30 and 5:30PM would prevent this back up.

Subject: Dispute immobilization notice

Good evening, 

I’m trying to reach someone to dispute a citation I received today at 12:27. I parked at the holiday Inn off university st. Ran inside chick-fil-a to grab lunch for my wife and I and came back out and my car was booted. There was no sign saying no parking or parking enforced/towing enforced.  I just moved here from Texas and did know where I could park. The immobilization notice is not filled out with any of my vehicle information. I don’t believe I should have been booted and forced to pay $76.75 to have the boot removed.

3619577,Archived,Other,"Back in June I reported a continuing problem of vehicles speeding on 24th Blvd in the Cherry Tree/Forest of the Unicorn/The Lakes area. It is particularly bad between Alpine Drive and 45th Ave.The problem was reported to GPD who said they had addressed it and would be monitoring the situation. I've seen NO such evidence that they are attempting to monitor the speeders on this street. Here was their reply:

""311GNV wrote:
Per GPD, they last addressed this issue 01-26-2017. We deployed the Stealth stat and Speed trailer. The posted speed limit on NW 24th BLVD is 35MPH. Per the speeds recorded by the Stealth Stat, we learned the average speed travelled on the roadway during 01-23-2017/01-27-2017 was 37MPH. It should be noted; however, that it did record a speed of 97MPH. The Traffic Safety Team and zone officers will continue to monitor traffic in this area.""

I seriously DOUBT the average speed is 37 mph!!! After the first day of the speeding device being deployed, logically, most people will drive slower. But there should be GRAVE concerns that even one vehicle was clocked at 97 mph!!! The posted speed is 35, most people are going at least 45 to 50. 
There has been an accident (see attached photo) with a vehicle running off the road and catching on fire at the intersection of 24th Blvd and 45th Ave since I reported this problem. I have personally seen 3 vehicles passing on the double yellow line on this street with oncoming traffic since I first reported this problem. 

School will be starting again soon and there will be children and parents walking in the sidewalks daily. Eventually there is going to be a horrible accident because of the way people are driving on this street. This IS a problem. This street needs, at least, speed bumps put in on the stretch between Alpine Drive and the school zone speed light just beyond Birnam Woods Way. 
I am imploring GPD to take this problem seriously...PLEASE!

3710514,Archived,Maintenance Ditch/Drainage/Flooding,There is flooding occurring in the parking lot near the 300s apartment building. The water appears to be coming from the woods and draining to the storm drain in the parking lot. The path in which the water is flowing is directly through where people should park. Coincidentally this flows right in front of my apartment and directly where I have to park. This flooding and poor drainage system flow has been occurring will before hurricane Irma. Before Irma and now after Irma there is pooling drainage water ranging from 2 to 3 inches deep. It's to the point where I have to wear boots to get out of my car in order to get to my front door. This is a safety hazard. And it creates an area for mosquitoes to Harbor. Can someone please fix. The other day my foot got stuck in the mud. And I almost tripped and fell.

In addition to overgrown trees, grass and debris, this road is difficult to navigate when another car is coming in the opposite direction because of the width.  Is this road a safe and appropriate width and are the property owners and city keeping the vegetation and debris out of the roadway? Two, there are no lines on this road marking any boundaries whatsoever.  There are no lines for the center, sides or at the stop sign.  Should lines be installed on this road?  Three, this road, along with 8th Street next to the Girls Scout Park, are frequently used as an alternate route by speeding drivers who do not want to use 6th Street and 8th Street.  These reckless drivers frequently speed down these side streets and ignore the stop sign at 8th Place and 8th Street.

4505620,Archived,Traffic Enforcement,"Commissioner Arreola received this e-mail from a citizen in his district (Russell Watkins -- rlw099@gmail.com):

Mr. Arreola - greetings.  we have a recurring problem with some sort of halfway house (1027 NW 40th Dr) and a couple of its residents.  one in particular regularly runs the stop sign @ NW 40th Dr and 10th Ave and speeds up and down the road.  this road has no sidewalks and is posted at 25 mph. 

the neighborhood knows very little about this residence, who stays there and when it was established.  i did observe a substantial police response to a suicide that occurred there, but was able to glean no information from the responding officers.  seems to me the neighborhood should have been notified that this facility was in operation.  in addition, the owner of record lists the property address as the contact, but she clearly doesn't live there.

one of my neighbors and i have both spoken to the speed - he has verbally abused me and threatened my neighbor.

i personally have reported this issue to the police at least 7 times, and i know of one neighbor who has also reported it.  the responses have ranged from no response, through ""we can't do anything"" to 2 physical visits that i am aware of.  i have provided the address, description and tag of the car, and simply asked that a patrol person stop by and have a word with this person.

this is a dangerous situation for all pedestrians and drivers.  i'm writing to you in the hope that you can generate some interest and activity to resolve this problem.

your assistance is appreciated.

The photo is from the file photo taken and shows this car in the same spot it currently is in, except there is about 4-5 months worth of tree mildew on it now and leaves.  Not sure why this isn't a violation?  All because ""there is no flat tires"" does not mean the vehicle has not moved.  Guess as long as I back my abandoned vehicle in the yard so you can't see if there is a tag and keep the tires inflated, it can sit there and rust to the ground?
